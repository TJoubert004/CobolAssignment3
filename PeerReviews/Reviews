Peer Review on Tristan Joubert 
  Peer Review: My pair programmer Tristan Joubert did very well with our project. 
He understood the assignment very well, and did an excellent job taking the project head on. 
I truly have no complaints with my partner, and I would work with him on future projects.


Peer Review on Clay Rasmussen
  Clay did well and communicated well with me as to what he did or didn’t do. We worked well together, 
  and he allowed me space to code in my own style, and I felt I did the same to him. Would recommend him as a group partner.
